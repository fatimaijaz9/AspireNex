# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model that can detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The dataset used in this project contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. This dataset presents a significant class imbalance, as the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the [Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). It contains 284,807 transactions, out of which 492 are frauds.

- Time: Number of seconds elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
- V1 - V28: Principal components obtained with PCA.
- Amount: Transaction amount.
- Class: 1 for fraud and 0 for non-fraud.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following key components:

- Data Loading and Preprocessing: 
  - Load the dataset.
  - Check for missing values and handle them.
  - Normalize the Amount feature.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
  - Statistical summary of the dataset.
  - Visualization of class distribution.

- Data Splitting: 
  - Split the data into training and testing sets.

- Model Training: 
  - Train Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models.
  - Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

- Handling Imbalance: 
  - Apply undersampling and oversampling (SMOTE) techniques to handle class imbalance.

- Model Saving and Loading: 
  - Save the best model using joblib.
  - Load the model for predictions.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to install the following dependencies:

bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn imbalanced-learn matplotlib seaborn joblib


## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit_card_fraud_detection.git
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   bash
   cd credit_card_fraud_detection
   
3. Run the script:
   bash
   python credit_card_fraud_detection.py
   

## Results
The Random Forest model achieved the best performance with the following metrics:
- Accuracy: 99.94%
- Precision: 99.92%
- Recall: 99.83%
- F1 Score: 99.88%

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. Handling class imbalance through undersampling and oversampling significantly improves model performance.

## Future Work
- Implement additional feature engineering techniques.
- Explore advanced machine learning models like XGBoost.
- Implement real-time fraud detection.

# Spam SMS Classification

## Overview
This project focuses on the classification of SMS messages as spam or ham (non-spam) using various machine learning techniques. The dataset used contains a collection of SMS messages labeled as either 'spam' or 'ham'. The goal is to build a model that accurately classifies SMS messages to help filter out spam.

## Data Description
The dataset used in this project is the Spam SMS Collection dataset. It contains 5,572 messages labeled as 'ham' or 'spam'.

### Data Fields
- label: Indicates whether the message is 'ham' (0) or 'spam' (1).
- message: The content of the SMS message.

### Data Exploration
- The dataset is imbalanced, with 4,825 ham messages and 747 spam messages.
- Various features such as word count, presence of currency symbols, and numbers are used to enhance the model's predictive power.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

sh
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn nltk


## Usage
1. Clone the Repository:
    sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam-sms-classification.git
    cd spam-sms-classification
    

2. Load and Explore the Dataset:
    The dataset is loaded using pandas and explored to understand its structure and check for any missing values.

    python
    import pandas as pd

    df = pd.read_csv('Spam SMS Collection.csv', encoding='ISO-8859-1', names=['label', 'message'])
    print(df.head())
    

3. Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:
    - Handle imbalanced dataset using oversampling.
    - Create new features such as word count, presence of currency symbols, and numbers.

    python
    df['word_count'] = df['message'].apply(lambda x: len(x.split()))
    df['contains_currency_symbol'] = df['message'].apply(lambda x: any(i in x for i in ['€', '$', '¥', '£', '₹']))
    df['contains_number'] = df['message'].apply(lambda x: any(char.isdigit() for char in x))
    

4. Data Cleaning:
    - Remove special characters and numbers using regular expressions.
    - Convert messages to lower case, tokenize, remove stop words, and lemmatize.

    python
    import re
    from nltk.corpus import stopwords
    from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer

    nltk.download('stopwords')
    nltk.download('wordnet')

    corpus = []
    wnl = WordNetLemmatizer()

    for sms_string in df['message']:
        message = re.sub('[^a-zA-Z]', ' ', sms_string).lower().split()
        filtered_words = [wnl.lemmatize(word) for word in message if word not in set(stopwords.words('english'))]
        corpus.append(' '.join(filtered_words))
    

5. Model Building and Evaluation:
    - Use TF-IDF vectorization to transform text data into feature vectors.
    - Train and evaluate models including Multinomial Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Voting Classifier.

    python
    from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, cross_val_score
    from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
    from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

    tfidf = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=500)
    X = tfidf.fit_transform(corpus).toarray()
    y = df['label']

    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    mnb = MultinomialNB()
    mnb.fit(X_train, y_train)
    y_pred = mnb.predict(X_test)

    print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
    

## Results
- The Multinomial Naive Bayes model achieved an average F1-Score of 0.943.
- Other models such as Decision Tree and Random Forest also showed promising results.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in classifying SMS messages as spam or ham. Future work could involve testing additional models, optimizing hyperparameters, and deploying the model for real-time spam detection.
